This is the read me for the unity game i developed.
I decided i wanted to create something more "physical" project compared to my previous project (data analysis with sql), and i really wanted something that was a game. I decided to use unity over other game development systems because my friend already used it, and we had a tutorial ready to go to teach me the basics. I firstly made a maze- sort of game, where you are a small square trying to make it through a maze. Then i learned about moving parts that are seperate from the player cube, and created spinning obstacles at the end of the maze. I learned a lot about Unity during the project, and built a small base of knowledge about C# as well, and is by far my most complicated project to date.
